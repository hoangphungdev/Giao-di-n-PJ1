Problem: Week 1 - k-Subsequence even

Description
Given a sequence of integers a1, a2, . . ., an. A k-subsequence is define to be a sequence of k consecutive elements: ai, ai+1, . . ., ai+k-1. The weight of a k-subsequence is the sum of its elements.
Given positive integers k and m. Compute the number Q of k-subsequences such that the weight is even.

Input
Line 1: contains 2 positive integers n, k (1 <= n <= 100000, 1 <= k <= n/2)
Line 2: contains a1, a2, . . ., an. (1 <= ai <= 10000)
Output
Write the value Q

Example
Input
6  3
2 4 5 1 1 2 

Output
2
