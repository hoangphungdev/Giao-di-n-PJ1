Problem: Insert at the middle of a sequence

Description
Given a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. The element in the middle is defined to be the element at index n/2 if n is even, and n/2+1, otherwise.
Perform a sequence of actions of the form:
ADD v: which add a value v right-after the element in the middle of an sequence a1, a2, ..., an. 
PRINT: print the sequence to stdout, elements are separated by a SPACE character
 
Input
Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100000)
Line 2: contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 <= ai <= 1000000)
Subsequent lines (number of lines can be up to 100000), each line contains an action of above format

Output
Write (in each line) the result of the corresponding PRINT action

Example
Input 
2
8 4 
ADD 6
ADD 5
ADD 4
PRINT
ADD 2
ADD 4
PRINT
#

Output
8 6 4 5 4
