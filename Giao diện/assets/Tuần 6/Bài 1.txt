Problem: Week 6 - Max Flow

Description
Given a network G = (V, E) which is a directed weighted graph. Node s is the source and node t is the target. c(u,v) is the capacity of the arc (u,v). Find the maximum flow on G.
Input
•Line 1: two positive integers N and M (1 <= N <= 104, 1 <= M <= 106)
•Line 2: contains 2 positive integers s and t
•Line i+2 (I = 1,. . ., M): contains two positive integers u and v which are endpoints of ith arc

Output
  Write the value of the max-flow found
