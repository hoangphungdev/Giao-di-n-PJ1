Problem: Week 6 - Shortest Path between 2 nodes on a directed graph with non-negative weights

Description
Given a directed graph G = (V,E) in which V = {1,2,...,n) is the set of nodes. Each arc (u,v) has a non-negative weight w(u,v). Given two nodes s and t of G. Find the shortest path from s to t on G.

Input
Line 1: contains two integers n and m which are the number of nodes and the number of arcs of G (1 <= n <= 100000)
Line i + 1(i = 1,2,...,m): contains 3 integers u, v, w in which w is the weight of arc(u,v) (0 <= w <= 100000)
Line m+2: contains two integers s and t

Output
Write the weight of the shortest path found or write -1 if no path from s to t was found
